## Introduction

Have you ever heard about dependecy inversion principle?

For sure, you know or at least you have heard about [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), an acronym for the five object-oriented design principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.
  
After some years in IT sector all the people knows what to say when someone ask about design, and you tend to say yes SOLID, even you can enumerate all the principles. 

> But, did you really know what 'D' of SOLID means? 

Dependency inversion principle (from now on DIP) is the last principle and possibly of the unknown ones, even it is more than 20 years old.

The goal of this project is to explain, apply and put in practice this pattern to show how to create and design a **simple architecture**.

### DIP Based architectures

Some software architectural patterns are based on this pattern:

- Hexagonal architecture
- Onion architecture
- Clean architecture

Also mention that software development process as Domain Driven Design also take benefits and depend on dependency inversion. 

The base of all of them is the same and simple, just invert the dependencies to mantain your domain code, the hearth of your application, clean and decoupled. 

## Explaining DIP

The principle says:[^fn1]
> _A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions._
> 
> _B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions._

But, what it means? 

Let's imagine we want to create a simplistic design for a service that provides tickets in an issue tracking application like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

I will use java as a language to go through this problem, as it is one of the most well known languages nowadays, but could be applied to almost any programming language.

In the traditional layered architecture we would think in something like:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tickets_0.png">
</p>
Now, we could follow the principle and add the abstraction:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tickets_1.png">
</p>

I just divided the different layers in different packages, but the separation can be logical or even physical, in different projects.

We can even add some code:

_This is just sample code, in order to explain the problem, is not production code_

```java
package my.awesome.project.services

public class TicketsService {

  private TicketsRepository TicketsRepository;

  public TicketsService(TicketsRepository ticketsRepository) {
    TicketsRepository = ticketsRepository;
  }

  public List<Ticket> findAll() {
    return ticketsRepository.findAll();
  }
}
```
```java
package my.awesome.project.repositories

public interface TicketsRepository {
  List<Ticket> findAll();
}
```
We can create the most simplest database in memory:

```java
package my.awesome.project.repositories

public class TicketsRepositoryImpl implements TicketsRepository{
  
  public List<Ticket> list;

  public TicketsRepositoryImpl(List<Ticket> list) {
    this.list = list;
  }

  @Override
  public List<Ticket> findAll() {
    return list;
  }
}
```
Just notice that the interface and the implementation are tied together in the same package/module.
 
Easy right?

Now you think you are applying the fifth solid pattern but the reallity is that you are doing totally the **opposite** thing. <span style="color:#EA735A;">You are violating the principle!!</span>

So, read again the first phrase of the principle:

> _High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules_

In our previous solution, high level module (business rules) is depending totally on the low level module (the database access).

Let's rewind to the beginning, to the name of the principle, **dependency inversion**, so we could start again, but inverting the dependency: 
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tickets_2.png">
</p> 
Easy to draw, now add more detail:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tickets_4.png">
</p> 

Change some naming, providing them with a meaningful names ( that topic could cover another entire post ):
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/tickets_3.png">
</p> 

And some sample code to how it could looks like:

_Again: This is just sample code, in order to explain the problem, is not production code_

```java
package my.awesome.project.usecases

public class GetTicketsUseCase {

  private FindTickets findTickets;

  public GetTicketsUseCase(FindTickets findTickets) {
    this. findTickets = findTickets;
  }

  public List<Ticket> findAll() {
    return findTickets.findAll();
  }
}
```
```java
package my.awesome.project.usecases

public interface FindTickets {
  List<Ticket> findAll();
}
```
**Important**: If we took a look on the packages, you have should notice that now the interface belongs to the high level module, so the use case define how it wants to access the tickets.

```java
package my.awesome.project.repositories

public class InMemoryTicketsRepository implements FindTickets, AddTickets{

  public List<Ticket> list;

  public TicketsRepositoryImpl(List<Ticket> list) {
    this.list = list;
  }

  @Override
  public List<Ticket> findAll() {
    return list;
  }

  @Override
  public List<Ticket> add(Ticket ticket) {
    list.add(ticket);
    return list;
  }
}
``` 

That's it!

What do you think? Now, we are applying correctly the inversion, low level policies (database access) are now depending upon high level policies (use cases).

But wait wait wait ... Each use case class will only use some of the facilities of the database. Then each usecase/s will provide an interface that gives them access to just some functionalities.

> So, high level modules own the interfaces that the low level must implement? 

Yes!

> We will have a lot of interfaces!

Yes, and it is called [Interface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle), another principle, the dependency inversion principle leads us to another one.[^fn2]

### Benefits

- Independent of any external influence: Your business rules, your domain simply wonâ€™t know anything at all about the outside world. It will be easy to swap any dependency and you can use dependencies as a tools.
	- Independent of UI
	- Independent of databases
	- Independent of libraries
	- Independent of frameworks 
	
- Loose coupling between layers
- Testable: Your core can be tested without the UI, Database or framework 


### Drawbacks

There are no many drawbacks on this pattern, the problem is how people apply it:

- Overcomplicating/overengineering: People tend to create complicated architectures on top of that, but the pattern is really simple and powerful.
- Misunderstanding: People misunderstand the pattern, and they just create abstractions for any component. Decoupling for the sake of decoupling has no sense.


## Creating a simple architecture

Now that we understand the pattern, let's use it to create a simple and clean architecture using DIP as a base to decouple all our application from the rest.
